## Features ðŸŒŸ

    **Multi-Language Support:** Execute code in a plethora of languages - from mainstream ones like Python, Java, C++, JavaScript, to esoteric ones like Rockstar, Cow, and Lolcode.
    **Containerized Execution:** Ensures safe and isolated code execution environment.
    **Discord Integration:** Directly execute code from Discord with an easy-to-use command system.
    **User Roles and Authorization:** Manage permissions with roles like admin, user, unrestricted, and owner.
    **User Debug Information:** Quickly access user roles and registered commands.

## How to Use ðŸ“˜
To execute code, use the prefix for code execution ($ by default), followed by three backticks and the language that you would like to code in. Then, on a new line below that, you can start writing code. End it with a new line and another three backticks.
