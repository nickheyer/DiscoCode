## General Instructions


### Accessing The Web-UI

#### *You will need to get the IP address of the computer hosting DiscoCode. On Windows, you would typically type `ipconfig` on the host machine and look for your `ipv4`.*

#### *If you would like to access DiscoCode remotely, as in not on the same network as the host machine, you will need to do some port forwarding to expose port 6565 to the internet. Run into trouble? Feel free to join the [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/6Z9yKTbsrP)!*

<hr />

### Configuration

#### *DiscoCode requires a small amount of configuration before you can begin making requests. Discord Token for example.*

<hr />

#### *To get your Discord Token, go to the "bot" tab in your developer portal. You may need to click "reset Token" and/or enter authentication code if you have 2FA enabled. Make sure to enable all `Privileged Gateway Intents`)*

#### *If you haven't already, now is also a good time to invite the bot to the server or servers you would like to monitor, you can do that via the Discord Developer Portal. Admin access is the only level we have tested. Anything less may result in errors.*

## Usage


### Add Yourself As An Admin

In the Web UI, click "Users". Add yourself as a user, but before confirming, change "Non-Admin" to "Admin". Your username should match your Discord username. These are automatically populated in the search bar when the bot is running and can see other users.


### Test That The Bot Is Running

Type the following into a discord chat message that the bot can see:

```
!dc help
```
